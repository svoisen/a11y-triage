# Mozilla a11y Triage

The script in this repository updates and generates triage duty cycle rotations for the Mozilla Accessibility team. Data is published as JSON for consumption by release management auto-nag bots, as well as ICAL for consumption by team members.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Copy `config.template.json` to `config.json` and edit as needed.

## Adding a Triage Cycle

Run `npm run update`. Output (JSON and ICAL files) will be placed in the `dist` directory.

## Publishing Updated Data

Run `npm run publish`. This will publish everything in the `dist` directory to the `gh-pages` branch and push it to GitHub.

## Resetting All Data

**Note:** This will erase all triage history in `history.json` and start triage rotation over using the first team member listed on `config.json`.

Run `npm run reset`.
